\subsection{Artificial regularization term}
\label{sec:mem_logM}

The $m_{\Pgt\Pgt}$ distribution reconstructed in $\PHiggs \to \Pgt\Pgt$ signal events is expected to peak close to the true value of the $\PHiggs$ boson mass,
while the distribution for the irreducible $\PZ/\Pggx \to \Pgt\Pgt$ background is steeply falling.
The sensitivity to discover a $\PHiggs$ boson signal increases if high mass tails due to resolution effects are reduced.
In order to reduce the number of background events reconstructed in the high mass tail,
we add an artificial regularization term of form $\kappa \, \log m_{\Pgt\Pgt}^{\textrm{test}(i)}$ to the logarithm of the probability density $P(\bm{p^{\vis(1)}},\bm{p^{\vis(2)}},\bm{p^{\rec}}|m_{\Pgt\Pgt}^{\textrm{test}(i)})$, 
computed according to Eq.~(\ref{eq:mem_with_hadRecoil}).
In case of non-zero $\kappa$,
the procedure described in Section~\ref{sec:mem_numericalMaximization} for finding the best estimate $\hat{m}_{\Pgt\Pgt}$ for the mass of the $\Pgt$ pair is altered.
Instead of fitting $\log P(\bm{p^{\vis(1)}},\bm{p^{\vis(2)}},\bm{p^{\rec}}|m_{\Pgt\Pgt}^{\textrm{test}(i)})$ versus $m_{\Pgt\Pgt}^{\textrm{test}(i)}$ by a second order polynomial,
we fit the sum of $\log P(\bm{p^{\vis(1)}},\bm{p^{\vis(2)}},\bm{p^{\rec}}|m_{\Pgt\Pgt}^{\textrm{test}(i)})$ and $\kappa \, \log m_{\Pgt\Pgt}^{\textrm{test}(i)}$.
The value $\hat{m}_{\Pgt\Pgt}$ 
is still taken to be the point at which the polynomial reaches its maximum.
The parameter $\kappa$ is chosen with the objective of maximizing the separation of the signal from the background.
We find that a value $\kappa \approx 5$ represents the best compromise between reducing the high mass tail of the $m_{\Pgt\Pgt}$ distribution 
for the $\PZ/\Pggx \to \Pgt\Pgt$ background while keeping the bias on the $m_{\Pgt\Pgt}$ distribution reconsted in signal events minimal.
