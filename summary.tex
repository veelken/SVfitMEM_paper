\section{Summary}
\label{sec:summary}

An algorithm for reconstruction of the $\PHiggs$ boson mass in events
in which the $\PHiggs$ boson decays into a pair of $\Pgt$ leptons has been
presented.
The algorithm has been used in data analyses performed by the CMS
collaboration during LHC run $1$.
The relative resolution on the $\PHiggs$ boson mass amounts to typically
$15$--$20\%$.

Two improvements to the algorithm have been developed in preparation
for LHC run $2$.
The first concerns the rigorous formulation of the
algorithm in terms of the ME method.
The modelling of the experimental resolution on the $\pT$ of $\tauh$ via TF in the ME
formalism constitutes the second improvement.
Taken together, the two improvements enhance the relative resolution on the $\PHiggs$ boson mass
achieved by the algorithm by $10$--$20\%$.

The development of the formalism to handle $\Pgt$ lepton decays
in the ME method constitutes an important result of this paper.
It allows to extend the matrix elements generated by automatized tools such as
CompHEP or MadGraph by the capability to handle the
$\Pgt$ decays. We expect this to be very useful for future
applications of the ME method to data analyses with $\Pgt$ leptons in
the final state.
