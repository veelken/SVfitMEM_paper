\section{Summary}
\label{sec:summary}

An algorithm for reconstruction of the $\PHiggs$ mass $m_{\PHiggs}$ in events with
$\PHiggs$ bosons decaying into a pair of $\Pgt$ leptons has been
presented.
The algorithm has been used in $\PHiggs$ analyses performed by the CMS
collaboration during LHC run $1$.
It achieves a relative resolution on the $\PHiggs$ mass of typically
$15$--$20\%$.
The algorithm has enhanced the sensitivity of the SM $\PHiggs \to
\Pgt\Pgt$ analysis by about $40\%$.

Two improvements to the algorithm have been developed in preparation
for LHC run $2$.
The first development concerns the rigorous formulation of the
algorithm in terms of the ME method.
The modelling of the experimental resolution on the visible $\Pgt$
decay products produced in hadronic $\Pgt$ decays via TF in the ME
formalism constitutes the second development.
The two developments improve the resolution on $m_{\PHiggs}$
achieved by the algorithm by $10$--$20\%$.

The development of the formalism to handle $\Pgt$ lepton decays
in the ME method constitutes an important result of this paper.
It allows to extend the ME generated by automatized tools such as
\textsc{CompHEP} or \textsc{MadGraph} by routines for handling the
$\Pgt$ decays, which we expect will be very useful for other
applications of ME techniques to data analyses with $\Pgt$ leptons in
the final state in the future.
