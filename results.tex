\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}

The performance of the $m_{\Pgt\Pgt}$ reconstruction is studied using
simulated samples of $\PHiggs \to \Pgt\Pgt$ and $\PZ/\Pggx \to \Pgt\Pgt$ events.
A SM $\PHiggs \to \Pgt\Pgt$ signal sample for a $\PHiggs$ boson of $m_{\PHiggs} = 125$~\GeV is generated with the next-to-leading-order (NLO) program POWHEG v2~\cite{POWHEG1,POWHEG2,POWHEG3}.
We also study the $m_{\Pgt\Pgt}$ reconstruction in events containing pseudoscalar $\PHiggs$ bosons of mass $200$, $300$, $500$, $800$, $1200$, $1800$, and $2600$~\GeV.
The latter samples are generated with the LO generator PYTHIA 8.2~\cite{pythia8}.
In all cases, the $\PHiggs$ bosons are produced by the gluon fusion process.
The $\PZ/\Pggx \to \Pgt\Pgt$ background sample is generated with the LO MadGraph program, in the version MadGraph\_aMCatNLO 2.2.2~\cite{MadGraph_aMCatNLO}.
All events are generated for proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 13$~\TeV centre-of-mass energy.
The samples produced by MadGraph and POWHEG are generated with the NNPDF3.0 set of parton distribution functions,
while the samples produced by PYTHIA use the NNPDF2.3LO set~\cite{NNPDF1,NNPDF2,NNPDF3}.
Parton shower and hadronization processes are modelled using the generator PYTHIA with the tune CUETP8M1~\cite{PYTHIA_CUETP8M1tune_CMS}.
The latter is based on the Monash tune~\cite{PYTHIA_MonashTune}.
The decays of $\Pgt$ leptons, including polarization effects, are modelled by PYTHIA.

The experimental resolutions on the $\pT$ of $\tauh$ and on the $\pXhat^{\rec}$ and $\pYhat^{\rec}$ of the hadronic recoil 
are simulated by sampling from the TF described in
Sections~\ref{sec:mem_TF_tauToHadDecays}
and~\ref{sec:mem_TF_hadRecoil}.
The $\eta$ and $\phi$ of $\tauh$,
as well as the $\pT$, $\eta$, and $\phi$ of electrons and muons are assumed to be reconstructed perfectly.

Distributions in $m_{\Pgt\Pgt}$ are computed separately for events in which 
both $\Pgt$ leptons decay hadronically ($\tauh\tauh$), 
events in which one $\Pgt$ lepton decays hadronically and the other into a muon ($\Pgm\tauh$),
and events in which one $\Pgt$ lepton decays into a muon and the other into an electron ($\Pe\Pgm$).
The visible $\Pgt$ decay products are required to pass selection criteria on $\pT$ and $\eta$,
which are motivated by the SM $\PHiggs \to \Pgt\Pgt$ analysis performed by the CMS collaboration during LHC run $1$~\cite{HIG-13-004}.
Events in the $\tauh\tauh$ decay channel are required to contain
two $\tauh$ of $\pT > 45$~\GeV and $\vert\eta\vert < 2.1$.
Events in the $\Pgm\tauh$ channel
are required to contain a muon of $\pT > 20$~\GeV and $\vert\eta\vert < 2.1$ and a $\tauh$ of $\pT > 30$~\GeV and $\vert\eta\vert < 2.3$.
Events selected in the $\Pe\Pgm$ channel are required to contain a muon with $\vert\eta\vert < 2.1$ and an electron with $\vert\eta\vert < 2.4$.
The lepton of higher $\pT$ (either the electron or the muon) is required to satisfy the condition $\pT > 20$~\GeV,
while the lepton of lower $\pT$ is required to satisfy $\pT > 10$~\GeV.
Similar selection criteria on $\pT$ and $\eta$ of the visible $\Pgt$ decay products were applied in the $\PHiggs \to \Pgt\Pgt$
analyses performed by the ATLAS
collaboration during LHC run $1$~\cite{ATLAS_HiggsTauTau_SM,ATLAS_HiggsTauTau_MSSM}.

The $m_{\Pgt\Pgt}$ distributions reconstructed using the 
improved version of the SVfit algorithm described in this paper
are compared to the distributions in $m_{\Pgt\Pgt}$ reconstructed by the previous version of the
SVfit algorithm, described in Ref.~\cite{SVfit}, and by the ``collinear-approximation'' (CA)
method~\cite{massRecoCollinearApprox}.
The improved version of the SVfit algorithm is denoted by SVfitMEM 
and is run with two values of the $\kappa$ parameter.
For the $\Pgm\tauh$ and $\tauh\tauh$ channel we use $\kappa = 0$ and $\kappa = 3$,
and for the $\Pe\Pgm$ channel we use $\kappa = 0$ and $\kappa = 2$.
The non-zero $\kappa$ value has been chosen to yield the optimal resolution on $m_{\Pgt\Pgt}$,
while the value $\kappa = 0$ has been chosen for comparison, to demonstrate the effect of the artificial regularization term described in Section~\ref{sec:mem_logM}.
We refer to the previous version of the SVfit algorithm as ``classic'' SVfit.
The $m_{\Pgt\Pgt}$ distributions reconstructed by the different algorithms
in $\PZ/\Pggx \to \Pgt\Pgt$ background and $\PHiggs \to \Pgt\Pgt$ signal events
of mass $125$, $200$, $300$, $500$, and $800$~\GeV
are shown in Figs.~\ref{fig:massDistributions_tautau} to~\ref{fig:massDistributions_emu}.
The axis of abscissae and the ordinate are drawn in logarithmic scale to better visualize differences in the high mass tails.

The distributions in $m_{\Pgt\Pgt}$ reconstructed by the SVfitMEM algorithm with $\kappa = 0$ and by the CA method
both exhibit pronounced high mass tails, which reduce the sensitivity of the SM $\PHiggs \to \Pgt\Pgt$ analysis,
as, due to resolution effects, a sizeable fraction of $\PZ/\Pggx \to \Pgt\Pgt$ background events
are reconstructed near the signal region $m_{\Pgt\Pgt} \approx 125$~\GeV.
The advantage of the SVfitMEM algorithm with $\kappa =
0$ is that it provides a physical solution for every event,
while the CA method fails to yield a physical solution for about $50\%$ of the events.
The fraction of events for which the CA method fails to find a physical solution is reflected by the normalization of the distribution.

The high mass tail in the $m_{\Pgt\Pgt}$ distribution reconstructed by
the SVfitMEM algorithm is reduced substantially by using
a small positive $\kappa$.
The distributions in $m_{\Pgt\Pgt}$ reconstructed by the SVfitMEM
algorithm with $\kappa = 3$ in the $\tauh\tauh$ and $\Pgm\tauh$ channels and with $\kappa = 2$ in the $\Pe\Pgm$ channel
are similar to the distributions in $m_{\Pgt\Pgt}$ reconstructed by the classic SVfit algorithm.
We conclude that the absence of a proper normalization of the likelihood function in the classic SVfit algorithm
has an effect that is similar to using an artificial regularization term of the form described in Section~\ref{sec:mem_logM} with small positive $\kappa$.

In all three decay channels, the SVfitMEM algorithm significantly improves the separation of the SM $\PHiggs \to \Pgt\Pgt$ signal 
from the irreducible $\PZ/\Pggx \to \Pgt\Pgt$ background, yielding a substantial gain in analysis sensitivity
compared to alternative mass observables.
The increase in signal-to-background separation is illustrated in
Fig.~\ref{fig:distributions_mVis_vs_SVfit},
which compares the distributions in $m_{\Pgt\Pgt}$ for the $\PZ/\Pggx \to \Pgt\Pgt$ background and for $\PHiggs \to \Pgt\Pgt$ signals of different mass
to the corresponding distributions in $m_{\vis}$,
the mass of the visible $\Pgt$ decay products.
The mass of the $\Pgt$ lepton pair reconstructed by the CA method is not included in the comparison, as it performs worse compared to $m_{\vis}$ in terms of resolution
and has the further disadvantage of not yielding a physical solution for every event.
Numerical values of the mean and root-mean-square (RMS) values
of the $m_{\Pgt\Pgt}$ and $m_{\vis}$ distributions in simulated $\PZ/\Pggx \to \Pgt\Pgt$ background events
and $\PHiggs \to \Pgt\Pgt$ signal events of mass $125$, $200$, $300$, $500$, $800$, $1200$, $1800$, and $2600$~GeV
are given in Table~\ref{tab:resolutions_mVis_vs_SVfit}.
Compared to $m_{\vis}$,
the SVfitMEM algorithm with small positive $\kappa$ improves the relative resolution,
quantified by the ratio of RMS to mean, by up to $60\%$.
The improvement in resolution for $\PHiggs$ boson signals of high mass improves the separation of hypothetical high mass signals
from backgrounds other than $\PZ/\Pggx \to \Pgt\Pgt$ also.
The improvement in mass resolution achieved by the SVfitMEM algorithm increases in events
containing $\PHiggs$ bosons of high $\pT$,
a fact which has been utilized to further increase the sensitivity of the SM $\PHiggs \to \Pgt\Pgt$ analysis performed by the CMS collaboration during LHC run $1$~\cite{HIG-13-004}.
Compared to the classic SVfit algorithm, the SVfitMEM algorithm yields an improvement in $m_{\Pgt\Pgt}$ resolution by $5$--$10\%$.
The improvement is due to the usage of a proper normalization of the probability density 
$\mathcal{P}(\bm{p}^{\vis(1)},\bm{p}^{\vis(2)};\pX^{\rec},\pY^{\rec}|m_{\PHiggs})$, given by Eq.~(\ref{eq:mem_with_hadRecoil}),
and of the TF that account for the experimental resolution on the $\pT$ of $\tauh$, described in Section~\ref{sec:mem_TF_tauToHadDecays}.

The distributions in $m_{\Pgt\Pgt}$ reconstructed by the
SVfitMEM algorithm with small positive $\kappa$ exhibit the best
resolution in the $\tauh\tauh$ channel and the worst resolution in the $\Pe\Pgm$ channel.
The difference in resolution between the $\tauh\tauh$, $\Pgm\tauh$,
and $\Pe\Pgm$ channels
is due to the fact that the fraction $z$ of
$\Pgt$ lepton energy that is carried by the visible $\Pgt$ decay
products is typically high in case of hadronic $\Pgt$ decays
and low in case of leptonic $\Pgt$ decays, \cf Fig.~\ref{fig:tauDecay_z}.
The presence of a $\tauh$ of high $\pT$ signals the decay of a
$\PHiggs$ boson of high mass.
In this case, either the $\pT$ of the visible decay products of the other $\Pgt$ is high too,
or the event contains high $\pT$ neutrinos, the momenta of which are imbalanced in the transverse plane,
indicating the decay of a $\PHiggs$ boson of high mass  by means of large $\MET$~\footnote{
  The imbalance in $\pX^{\miss}$ and $\pY^{\miss}$ enters the SVfitMEM algorithm via Eq.~(\ref{eq:met}).}.
The low mass tail of the $m_{\Pgt\Pgt}$ distribution arises from events in which the visible $\Pgt$ decay products
both have low $\pT$.
If in addition the $\Pgt$ leptons are ``back-to-back'' in the transverse plane ($\Delta\phi_{\Pgt\Pgt} \approx \pi$),
which is typically the case in $\PHiggs \to \Pgt\Pgt$ events produced via the gluon fusion process,
the neutrinos produced in the two $\Pgt$ decays to be emitted in opposite hemispheres, 
with the effect that their contributions to $\MET$ cancel.
Such events are indistinguishable from the decays of $\PHiggs$ bosons of low mass
and are hence assigned low $m_{\Pgt\Pgt}$ values by the SVfitMEM algorithm.

The distributions in $m_{\Pgt\Pgt}$ reconstructed by the SVfitMEM algorithm 
peak close to the true mass of the $\Pgt$ lepton pair.
The ratio of the mean of the $m_{\Pgt\Pgt}$ distribution to the true mass is closer to unity and the ratio of RMS to mean is smaller
in case of the $\PZ/\Pggx \to \Pgt\Pgt$ background and of low mass $\PHiggs \to \Pgt\Pgt$ signals, compared to $\PHiggs \to \Pgt\Pgt$ signals of high mass.
The reason for this behaviour are the $\pT$ cuts that are applied on the visible $\Pgt$ decay products.
The $\pT$ cuts have the effect of removing events in which the $\Pgt$ leptons are back-to-back in the transverse plane,
the visible decay products of both $\Pgt$ leptons have low $\pT$ and the $\MET$ is small.
The effect is present in the $\tauh\tauh$, $\Pgm\tauh$, and $\Pe\Pgm$ channels and can be seen in the $m_{\vis}$ as well as in the $m_{\Pgt\Pgt}$ distributions,
except for the $\PZ/\Pggx \to \Pgt\Pgt$ background in the $\tauh\tauh$ channel.
In the latter case,
the $\pT > 45$~\GeV requirement on the $\tauh$ 
removes all $\PZ/\Pggx \to \Pgt\Pgt$ background in which the $\PZ$ boson has low $\pT$,
as only $\PZ/\Pggx \to \Pgt\Pgt$ events in which the $\tauh$ are boosted in $\PZ$ boson direction have a chance to satisfy the condition $\pT > 45$~\GeV.
In events containing a $\PZ$ boson of high $\pT$,
the $\Pgt$ leptons are typically not back-to-back in the transverse plane.
In events passing the $\pT$ cut,
the mass of the visible $\Pgt$ decay products decreases proportional to the cosine of the angle between the $\Pgt$ leptons,
$m_{\vis} \approx \pT^{\vis(1)} \, \cosh\eta_{\vis(1)} \, \pT^{\vis(2)} \, \cosh\eta_{\vis(2)}\, \left( 1 - \cos\sphericalangle(\Pgt,\Pgt) \right)$
and may be significantly smaller than two times $45$~\GeV in events with $\PZ$ bosons of high $\pT$.
In the $\Pgm\tauh$ and $\Pe\Pgm$ channels, as well as for $\PHiggs \to \Pgt\Pgt$ signal events of mass $m_{\PHiggs} \geq 125$~\GeV in the $\tauh\tauh$ channel,
the $\pT$ cuts that are applied on the visible $\Pgt$ decay products 
are sufficiently low to reduce the bias on the $\PZ$ and $\PHiggs$ boson $\pT$ distribution to a small level,
such that most $\Pgt$ leptons are back-to-back and $m_{\vis}$ typically exceeds two times the $\pT$ cut applied on the visible $\Pgt$ decay products.

\caption{
  Mean and root-mean-square (RMS) of the distributions in $m_{\vis}$ 
  and in $m_{\Pgt\Pgt}$ reconstructed by the SVfitMEM algorithm
  in simulated $\PZ/\Pggx \to \Pgt\Pgt$ background and $\PHiggs \to
  \Pgt\Pgt$ signal events selected in the decay channels $\tauh\tauh$
  (top), $\Pgm\tauh$ (centre) and $\Pe\Pgm$ (bottom).
  The signal events are generated for different $\PHiggs$ boson masses $m_{\PHiggs}$.
