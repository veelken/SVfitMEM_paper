\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}

The performance of the $m_{\Pgt\Pgt}$ reconstruction is studied using
simulated samples of $\PHiggs \to \Pgt\Pgt$ and $\PZ/\Pggx \to
\Pgt\Pgt$ events.
The $\PHiggs \to \Pgt\Pgt$ signal sample is generated with the next-to-leading-order (NLO) program POWHEG~\cite{POWHEG1,POWHEG2,POWHEG3}.
We study the $m_{\Pgt\Pgt}$ reconstruction in SM $\PHiggs \to \Pgt\Pgt$ events with $m_{\PHiggs} = 125$~\GeV
and in events containing pseudoscalar $\PHiggs$ bosons of mass $200$, $300$, $500$, and $700$~\GeV.
In all cases, the $\PHiggs$ boson are produced by the gluon fusion process.
The $\PZ/\Pggx \to \Pgt\Pgt$ background sample is generated with the LO MadGraph program~\cite{MadGraph}.
All events are generated for proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 13$~\TeV centre-of-mass energy.
The samples produced by MadGraph are generated with the CTEQ6L1 set of PDF,
while the samples produced by POWHEG use CTEQ6M~\cite{CTEQ6}.
Parton shower and hadronization processes are modelled using the generator PYTHIA~\cite{pythia8} with the \emph{Z2$^{*}$} tune.
The PYTHIA \emph{Z2$^{*}$} tune is obtained from the \emph{Z1} tune~\cite{PYTHIA_Z1tune_CMS},
which uses the CTEQ5L PDF, 
whereas \emph{Z2$^{*}$} adopts CTEQ6L~\cite{CTEQ6}.
The decays of $\Pgt$ leptons, including polarization effects, are modelled with TAUOLA~\cite{tauola}.

The experimental resolutions on $\pT^{\vis(i)}$ in case of hadronic
$\Pgt$ decays and on the hadronic recoil 
are simulated by sampling from the TF described in
Sections~\ref{sec:mem_TF_tauToHadDecays}
and~\ref{sec:mem_TF_hadRecoil}, respectively.
The $\eta$ and $\phi$ components of the of the $\bm{p}^{\vis(i)}$ vector as well as the $\pT$ of electrons and muons are assumed to be reconstructed perfectly.

The $m_{\Pgt\Pgt}$ distributions for signal and background
are computed separately for the decay channels 
$\Pgt\Pgt \to \textrm{hadrons} + \Pnut \, \textrm{hadrons} + \Pnut$ ($\tauh\tauh$), 
$\Pgt\Pgt \to \mununu \, \textrm{hadrons} + \Pnut$ ($\Pgm\tauh$), 
and $\Pgt\Pgt \to \mununu \, \enunu$ ($\Pe\Pgm$).
The events are required to pass selection criteria on $\pT$ and $\eta$ of the visible $\Pgt$ decay products
that are motivated by the SM $\PHiggs \to \Pgt\Pgt$ analysis performed by the CMS collaboration~\cite{HIG-13-004}.
Events selected in the $\tauh\tauh$ decay channel are required to contain
two $\tauh$ with $\pT > 45$~\GeV and $\vert\eta\vert < 2.1$,
while events selected in the $\Pgm\tauh$ channel
are required to contain one muon with $\pT > 20$~\GeV and $\vert\eta\vert < 2.1$ and one $\tauh$ with $\pT > 30$~\GeV and $\vert\eta\vert < 2.3$.
The events selected in the $\Pe\Pgm$ channel are required to contain a muon within $\vert\eta\vert < 2.1$ plus an electron within $\vert\eta\vert < 2.4$.
The lepton of higher $\pT$ is required to satisfy the condition $\pT >
20$~\GeV, while the lepton of lower $\pT$ is required to satisfy $\pT > 10$~\GeV.
Similar selection criteria on $\pT$ and $\eta$ are applied in the $\PHiggs \to \Pgt\Pgt$
analyses performed by the ATLAS
collaboration~\cite{ATLAS_HiggsTauTau_SM,ATLAS_HiggsTauTau_MSSM}.

The improved version of the SVfit algorithm described in this paper,
to which we refer to as SVfitMEM,
is used with two different values of the $\kappa$ parameter described in Section~\ref{sec:mem_logM}: $0$ and $5$.
The mass distributions reconstructed by the
SVfitMEM algorithm are compared to the previous version of the
SVfit algorithm described in Ref.~\cite{SVfit}, to which we refer to
as ``classic'' SVfit, and to the distribution of the $\PHiggs$ boson
mass reconstructed by the ``collinear-approximation'' (CA)
method~\cite{massRecoCollinearApprox},
as well as to the mass distribution of the visible $\Pgt$ decay products.
The results are shown in Figs.~\ref{fig:massDistributions_tautau} to~\ref{fig:massDistributions_emu}.
The ordinate is drawn in logarithmic scale to better visualize differences in the high mass tails.

The distributions reconstructed by the SVfitMEM algorithm with $\kappa = 0$ are very similar to the distributions of $m_{\Pgt\Pgt}$ reconstructed by the CA method.
In both cases, pronounced high mass tails reduce the sensitivity of the SM $\PHiggs \to \Pgt\Pgt$ analysis,
as a sizeable number of $\PZ/\Pggx \to \Pgt\Pgt$ background events
are reconstructed near the signal region at $m_{\Pgt\Pgt} \approx 125$~\GeV.
The main advantage of the SVfitMEM algorithm with $\kappa =
0$ is that it provides a physical solution for every event,
while the CA method yields physical solutions for less than $50\%$ of
the events only.
The number of events for which the CA method fails to find a physical solution is reflected in the normalization of the distribution.
The high mass tail in the $m_{\Pgt\Pgt}$ distribution of
the SVfitMEM algorithm is reduced substantially in case
$\kappa = 5$ is used instead of $\kappa = 0$.
The distributions of $m_{\Pgt\Pgt}$ reconstructed by the SVfitMEM
algorithm with $\kappa = 5$ and by the classic SVfit algorithm are
very similar.
We conclude that the arbitrary normalization used by the classic SVfit
algorithm has an effect that is similar to adding 
an artificial regularization term of form $5 \,
m_{\Pgt\Pgt}^{\textrm{test}(i)}$ to the logarithm of the probability
density given by Eq.~(\ref{eq:mem_with_hadRecoil}).

The distributions of $m_{\Pgt\Pgt}$ reconstructed by the
SVfitMEM algorithm with $\kappa = 5$ exhibit the best
resolution in the $\tauh\tauh$ channel and the worst resolution in the $\Pe\Pgm$ channel.
The difference in resolution between the $\tauh\tauh$, $\Pgm\tauh$,
and $\Pe\Pgm$ channels
is due to the fact that the fraction $z$ of
$\Pgt$ lepton energy carried by the visible $\Pgt$ decay
products is typically high in case of hadronic $\Pgt$ decays
and low in case of leptonic $\Pgt$ decays, \cf Fig.~\ref{fig:tauDecay_z}.
The presence of a $\tauh$ of high $\pT$ signalizes the decay of a
$\PHiggs$ boson of high mass.
In case the $\pT$ of the visible decay products is high
for one $\Pgt$, the second $\Pgt$ either also has high $\pT$ or the
event is likely to exhibit a significant
imbalance in transverse momentum.
In the latter case, the presence of high $\pT$ neutrinos indicate the decay of a $\PHiggs$ boson of high mass.
Note that the imbalance in transverse momentum, $\vecMET$, enters the
SVfitMEM algorithm via the relation between 
$\bm{p}^{vis(i)}$ and $\bm{p}^{\rec}$ vectors in Eq.~(\ref{eq:met}).
The low mass tail of the $m_{\Pgt\Pgt}$ distribution in the $\Pe\Pgm$
channel arises from events in which the electron as well as the muon
both have low $\pT$.
The $\Pgt$ leptons in $\PHiggs \to \Pgt\Pgt$ events produced via the
gluon fusion process are typically separated by $\Delta\phi \approx
\pi$ in the transverse plane,
causing the neutrinos produced in the $\Pgt$ decays to be emitted into
opposite hemispheres, with the effect that their contribution to $\vecMET$ cancels.
Events featuring a low $\pT$ electron, a low $\pT$ muon and low $\MET$
are indistinguishable from the decays of $\PHiggs$ bosons of low mass
and are hence assigned low $m_{\Pgt\Pgt}$ values by the SVfitMEM algorithm.
A similar effect can be seen in the distribution of $m_{\vis}$ 
for the $\Pe\Pgm$ channel.

In all three decay channels, the SVfitMEM algorithm significantly improves the separation of the $\PHiggs \to \Pgt\Pgt$ signal 
from the irreducible $\PZ/\Pggx \to \Pgt\Pgt$ DY background, yielding a substantial gain in analysis sensitivity.
The increase in signal-to-background separation is illustrated in
Fig.~\ref{fig:distributions_mVis_vs_SVfit},
which compares the signal and background distributions for $m_{\Pgt\Pgt}$ and $m_{\vis}$.
Numerical values of the means and of the root-mean-square (RMS) values
of the $m_{\Pgt\Pgt}$ and $m_{\vis}$ distributions are given in
Table~\ref{tab:resolutions_mVis_vs_SVfit}.

\caption{
  Mean and root-mean-square (RMS) of the $m_{\vis}$ and $m_{\Pgt\Pgt}$
  distributions
  reconstructed by the SVfitMEM algorithm with $\kappa = 5$
  in simulated $\PZ/\Pggx \to \Pgt\Pgt$ DY background and $\PHiggs \to
  \Pgt\Pgt$ signal events selected in the decay channels $\tauh\tauh$
  (top), $\Pgm\tauh$ (centre) and $\Pe\Pgm$ (bottom).
  The signal events are generated for different $\PHiggs$ boson masses $m_{\PHiggs}$.
