\subsection{Treatment of hadronic activity}
\label{sec:mem_hadRecoil}

The phase-space for QCD radiation is large at the centre-of-mass
energies of the LHC
and as a consequence, particles with masses up to a few hundred GeV 
are typically produced in association with a sizeable hadronic activity~\cite{Alwall:2010cq}.
We refer to the vectorial sum of all particles in the event that do not originate from the $\PHiggs$ boson decay
as the ``hadronic recoil'' and denote the corresponding momentum by $\bm{p}^{\rec}$.
CMS as well as ATLAS have developed sophisticated techniques to improve the reconstruction 
of the hadronic recoil~\cite{CMS-JME-13-003,ATLAS-CONF-2014-019}.

The effect of the hadronic recoil is to modify the kinematics of the $\PHiggs$ boson decay
by boosting the $\Pgt$ leptons and their decay products in the transverse plane.
The component of $\bm{p}^{\rec}$ in beam direction is not a problem, 
as it only changes the Bjorken scaling variables $x_{a}$ and $x_{b}$ in Eq.~(\ref{eq:mem}) slightly.
The components of $\bm{p}^{\rec}$ in the transverse plane need to be accounted for, however.
The LO ME that we use to model $\PHiggs$ boson production and decay
is adequate for events without hadronic activity,
in which the $\PHiggs$ boson has zero $\pT$.
In order to use the LO ME in analyses at the LHC,
the momenta of the visible $\Pgt$ decay products and of the neutrinos produced in the $\Pgt$ decay
need to be transformed into a frame in which the $\PHiggs$ boson has zero $\pT$.
The transformation is achieved by a Lorentz boost in the transverse plane,
using $(\EThat^{\rec}, \pXhat^{\rec}, \pYhat^{\rec}, 0)$ as boost
vector.
We denote the true values of energies and momenta by symbols with a
hat if they are given in the to laboratory frame, and by symbols a tilde in case they are given in the zero momentum frame of the $\PHiggs$ boson.

The hadronic recoil is reconstructed with a typical resolution of $10$--$20$~\GeV at the LHC~\cite{CMS-JME-13-003,ATLAS-CONF-2014-019}.
It is demonstrated in Ref.~\cite{Alwall:2010cq} that the imperfect reconstruction of the hadronic recoil
in the detector may cause a significant bias in case one reconstructs the masses of resonances
with the ME method and ignores the experimental resolution on the
hadronic recoil. We account
for the experimental resolution by introduction
of a TF $W_{\rec}( \pX^{\rec}, \pY^{\rec} | \pXhat^{\rec},
\pYhat^{\rec} )$.
We then marginalize Eq.~(\ref{eq:mem}) with respect to $\pXhat^{\rec}$ and $\pYhat^{\rec}$:
\begin{align}
& P(\bm{y},\pX^{\rec},\pY^{\rec}|m_{\PHiggs}) =
\frac{1}{\sigma(m_{\PHiggs})} \, \int \, dx_{a} \, dx_{b} \, d\Phi_{n} \,
d\pXhat^{\rec} \, d\pYhat^{\rec} \, \frac{f(x_{a}) f(x_{b})}{2 \,
  x_{a} \, x_{b} \, s} \nonumber \\
& \qquad (2\pi)^{4} \, \delta( x_{a} \, \Ehat_{a} + x_{b} \, \Ehat_{b} -
(\Ehat_{\rec} + \Ehat_{\Pgt(1)} + \Ehat_{\Pgt(2)}) ) \, \delta^{3}( x_{a} \,
\hat{\bm{p}}^{a} + x_{b} \, \hat{\bm{p}}^{b} - (\hat{\bm{p}}^{\rec} + \hat{\bm{p}}^{\Pgt(1)}
+ \hat{\bm{p}}^{\Pgt(2)}) ) \nonumber \\
& \qquad \vert \mathcal{M}(\bm{\tilde{p}},m_{\PHiggs}) \vert^{2} \, W(\bm{y}|\hat{\bm{p}}) \, W_{\rec}( \pX^{\rec}, \pY^{\rec} | \pXhat^{\rec}, \pYhat^{\rec} ) \, ,
\label{eq:mem_mod_hadRecoil}
\end{align}
where the symbol $\bm{y}$ refers to the measured momenta of the visible $\Pgt$ decay products, $\bm{p^{\vis(1)}}$ and $\bm{p^{\vis(2)}}$.
Using the relations $(\hat{E}_{a},\hat{\bm{p}}^{a}) = \frac{\sqrt{s}}{2} \, (1, 0,
0, 1)$ and $(\hat{E}_{b},\hat{\bm{p}}^{b}) = \frac{\sqrt{s}}{2} \, (1,
0, 0, -1)$
for the energies and momenta of the two colliding protons,
the integral over the $\delta$-function that ensures the conservation of energy and momentum can be expressed by:
\begin{align}
& \int \, dx_{a} \, dx_{b} \, d\pXhat^{\rec} \, d\pYhat^{\rec} \, \delta(
x_{a} \, \Ehat_{a} + x_{b} \, \Ehat_{b} - (\Ehat_{\rec} +
\Ehat_{\Pgt(1)} + \Ehat_{\Pgt(2)})) \nonumber \\
& \qquad \delta^{3}(
x_{a} \, \bm{p}^{a} + x_{b} \, \hat{\bm{p}}^{b} - (\hat{\bm{p}}^{\rec} +
\hat{\bm{p}}^{\Pgt(1)} + \hat{\bm{p}}^{\Pgt(2)})) \nonumber \\
= & \frac{2}{s} \, \int \,
d\pXhat^{\rec} \, d\pYhat^{\rec} \, 
\delta( \pXhat^{\rec} + \pXhat^{\Pgt(1)} + \pXhat^{\Pgt(2)} ) \,
\delta( \pYhat^{\rec} + \pYhat^{\Pgt(1)} + \pYhat^{\Pgt(2)} ) \, ,
\label{eq:delta4}
\end{align}
with:
\begin{align}
x_{a} = & \frac{1}{\sqrt{s}} \, (\Ehat_{\rec} + \Ehat_{\Pgt(1)} +
\Ehat_{\Pgt(2)} + \pZhat^{\rec} + \pZhat^{\Pgt(1)} + \pZhat^{\Pgt(2)})
\, , \nonumber \\
x_{b} = & \frac{1}{\sqrt{s}} \, (\Ehat_{\rec} + \Ehat_{\Pgt(1)} + \Ehat_{\Pgt(2)} - (\pZhat^{\rec} + \pZhat^{\Pgt(1)} + \pZhat^{\Pgt(2)})) \, .
\label{eq:xa_and_xb}
\end{align}
The integration over $d\pXhat^{\rec}$ and $d\pYhat^{\rec}$ then removes the $\delta$-functions 
$\delta( \pXhat^{\rec} + \pXhat^{\Pgt(1)} + \pXhat^{\Pgt(2)} )$ and
$\delta( \pYhat^{\rec} + \pYhat^{\Pgt(1)} + \pYhat^{\Pgt(2)} )$ and one obtains:
\begin{align}
&
P(\bm{p}^{\vis(1)},\bm{p}^{\vis(2)},\pX^{\rec},\pY^{\rec}|m_{\PHiggs})
= \frac{1}{\sigma(m_{\PHiggs})} \, \frac{32\pi^{4}}{s} \, \int \,
d\Phi_{n} \, \frac{f(x_{a}) f(x_{b})}{2 \, x_{a} \, x_{b} \, s} \, \vert \mathcal{M}(\bm{\tilde{p}},m_{\PHiggs}) \vert^{2} \, \hspace{2cm} \nonumber \\
& \qquad W(\bm{p}^{\vis(1)}|\hat{\bm{p}}^{\vis(1)}) \, W(\bm{p}^{\vis(2)}|\hat{\bm{p}}^{\vis(2)}) \, W_{\rec}( \pX^{\rec},\pY^{\rec} | \pXhat^{\rec},\pYhat^{\rec} ) \, ,
\label{eq:mem_with_hadRecoil}
\end{align}
with $x_{a}$ and $x_{b}$ given by Eq.~(\ref{eq:xa_and_xb}) and:
\begin{equation}
\pXhat^{\rec} = -(\pXhat^{\Pgt(1)} + \pXhat^{\Pgt(2)}) \, ,
\qquad \pYhat^{\rec} = -(\pYhat^{\Pgt(1)} + \pYhat^{\Pgt(2)}) \, .
\label{eq:xpXhat_and_pYhat}
\end{equation}
The form of the TF $W_{\rec}( \pX^{\rec},\pY^{\rec} | \pXhat^{\rec},\pYhat^{\rec} )$ is
discussed in Section~\ref{sec:mem_TF_hadRecoil}.

In practice, the TF for the hadronic recoil is equivalent to modelling
the resolution on $\vecMET$, the vectorial imbalance of momenta in the
transverse plane, referred to as ``missing transverse momentum''.
The following relations hold for the components of the $\vecMET$
vector:
\begin{equation}
\METx = - \left( \pX^{\vis(1)} + \pX^{\vis(2)} + \pX^{\rec} \right)
\, \mbox { and } \,
\METy = - \left( \pY^{\vis(1)} + \pY^{\vis(2)} + \pY^{\rec} \right) \, .
\label{eq:met}
\end{equation}
These relations are valid on reconstruction level as well as for the
true values of the momenta, \ie in case all $\pX$ and $\pY$ in
Eq.~(\ref{eq:met}) are replaced by $\pXhat$ and $\pYhat$.
The experimental resolution on electrons, muons and also on $\tauh$ is typically negligible compared to the resolution on the hadronic recoil.
As a consequence, the resolution on $\pX^{\rec}$ and $\pY^{\rec}$ is
very similar to the resolution on $\METx$ and $\METy$.
